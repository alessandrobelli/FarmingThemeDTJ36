This repository contains the Unreal Engine 5 source code for a top-down farming game with time-management and market mechanics. The game was developed in 36 hours for the üçØDevs That Jam 36-hour Challenge #14 Game Jam.

## Game Jam Details
* **Jam:** üçØDevs That Jam 36-hour Challenge #14
* **Date:** May 24th - May 25th, 2025
* **Theme:** Farming
* **Duration:** 36 hours

## How to Play
* **Movement:** Click on a grid cell to move your character.
* **Select Seed:** Use the 'A' and 'D' keys to cycle through available seeds to plant.
* **Interact:** Press 'E' when on a grid cell to:
    * Plant the currently selected seed (if the cell is empty and you own the seed).
    * Water a crop that needs it.
    * Harvest a crop that is ready.
    * Clear a withered crop.
* **Market Stall:**
    * **Auto-Sell:** Move near the stall, and after a brief moment, all your harvested crops will be sold automatically for coins.
    * **Buy Seeds:** An interface will appear at the stall allowing you to purchase new seeds.
* **Goal:** Earn as much money as possible! The game ends when the main timer (initially 60 seconds, plus bonus time from sales) reaches zero.
